    <meta property="og:description" content="Dryftwell is like an old friend in every city. Share your travel style, interests, and budget in our quiz so we can match you with the best local for you. Your local will use the information in your quiz to create a custom set of recs for you. Get a feed of recs in your app for the best things to do in the city for you. Save the recs you love and no the ones you don’t. Locals listen to your feedback, getting smarter and more personalized with each rec they send. Your trip tab keeps everything you’ve saved organized, easily accessible and viewable on a map. Get directions, check out the menu, and call to make a reservation all from the app.">
